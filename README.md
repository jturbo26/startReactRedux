# startReactRedux
My version of  a React/Redux bootstrapper.

Right now this is to get quickly started in a dev environment
without having to setup all the basics. It includes the following:

React
Redux w/ dev tools already setup  
react-router v4  
react-router-redux w/ <ConnectedRouter> so your url is tracked in your store  
redux-form because it makes working with forms so easy  

# Installation
Clone the repo  
yarn install  

# Run the app
yarn run dev
