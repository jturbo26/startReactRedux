# startReactRedux
My version of  a React/Redux boilerplate.

Right now this project is to get you started quickly in a dev  
environment without the bloat of other common repos. I made this  
for myself but figured others might want something simliar.    
It includes the following:

React
Redux w/ dev tools already setup  
react-router v4  
react-router-redux w/ ConnectedRouter so your url is tracked in your store
some generic components 

# Installation
Clone the repo  
yarn install  

# Run the app
yarn run dev
